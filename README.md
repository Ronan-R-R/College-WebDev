# Please note:
- All names here are randomly selected and not related to anyone I know, if it happens to correlate to you it's merely a coincidence.
- These snipets/projects I mostly don't have any original content/credits/notes to share limits.
- These are all done during me learning WebDev amongst other subjects so some may seem short/repetitive/pointless or bunched together.
- Some of these are purely examples, small tests or personal messing around where by I have terrible naming/near to no comments as most should be working.
- Any missing content should be easy to replace/modify for personal testing.
